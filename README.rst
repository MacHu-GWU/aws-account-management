You can use the following criterion to make decision:

- If you are start up company and your engineer team having 10 - 50 employees, usually Project-Based Account Structure is the best choice.
- If you are mass enterprise having 500+ engineers, usually Business Unit (BU) Account Structure is the best option.
- If you are in the mid of these two case, Hybird AWS Account structure may fits you best.
